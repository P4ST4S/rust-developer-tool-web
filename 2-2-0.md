## What's New in v2.2.0

Performance and reliability update: safer config writes, a decoupled process manager, and log streaming built for high-volume output.

### Major Changes
- Introduced a dedicated ProcessManager to separate IPC concerns from process lifecycle logic.
- Added batched log events (`log-batch`) with throttled IPC forwarding to avoid UI freezes.
- Switched backend errors to structured `AppError` codes for richer frontend handling.

### Improvements
- Log streaming now uses a ring buffer and batched writes to xterm.js.
- Terminal rewrites on filter changes are chunked to avoid blocking the UI thread.
- Config persistence now uses atomic temp-write + rename.

### Fixes
- `set_active_project` now validates, persists, then commits in-memory to avoid state divergence.

### Notes
- Binaries are built automatically via GitHub Actions.
